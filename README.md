# scripts
## Personal scripts that can be put into a new installs' `$HOME/bin` folder

## Installation

To install on a new system, clone this repo then run `./setup.sh` in the top level directory.

## Purpose

The main idea is to keep files that I would like to transfer between computers in a central repo, and keeping them in their own folder (`install`) makes it easy to add new scripts without having to change `setup.sh`.
